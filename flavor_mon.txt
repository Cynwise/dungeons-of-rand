Rat
A small rat eyes you hungrily. Feeling bold, it takes a chance, and strikes!
The rat moves with incredible agility, biting a small chunk out of your leg.
Low to the ground, the rat waits for the perfect oppurtunity...
The rat looks ugly, diseased, and hungry... and you look delectable!
A couple of scrapes and bruises aren't going to keep this rat away from a good meal!
The rat's eyes search for an escape... perhaps it bit off more than it could chew..?
The rat lies motionless on the ground. Congratulations. You beat a rodent to death.
As you fall, the rat quickly begins its work, excited at the prospect of a fresh meal.
Rat of Unusual Size
A huge rat approaches you. Its claws bloody and sharp. Its teeth coated in viscera.
The beast's teeth, sharp as daggers, bear down on your midsection... hungry for more.
The rat moves surprisingly fast for a creature of its size. It looks wary of you...
Despite the blood on its fur, the rat seems fine. Perhaps that blood is not its own...
The rat has taken some hits, but it doesnt seem bothered. If anything, it looks angry.
The beast is wheezing, and the floor is coated in its blood. Finish it while its low!!
The beast slumps to the ground, and lies still. You breathe a thankful sigh of relief.
The rat sinks its teeth into your jugular. As all fades, you hear a joyous screech.
Bandit
A person?! You approach, seeking a friendly face, but instead find daggers and malice.
The figure lunges forward, hoping their twisted blades strike true.
Daggers down, the bandit beckons you forward, as if daring you to try.
The armor is shoddy and piecemeal, but holds up fine. The bandit awaits your move.
Holes are present in the bandit's clothes and confidence. Press this advantage!
The clothes of the enemy are soaked red. Their breathing is haggard and weak.
You strike down the foe, dissapointed in their lack of humanity.
The dagger disembowels you, and you see the scowl turn into an unsettling grin.
