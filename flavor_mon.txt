Low to the ground, the rat waits for the perfect oppurtunity...
The rat looks ugly, diseased, and hungry... and you look delectable!
A couple of scrapes and bruises aren't going to keep this rat away from a good meal!
The rat's eyes search for an escape... perhaps it bit off more than it could chew..?

Rat of Unusual Size
The beast's teeth, sharp as daggers, bear down on your midsection... hungry for more.
The rat moves surprisingly fast for a creature of its size. It looks wary of you...
Despite the blood on its fur, the rat seems fine. Perhaps that blood is not its own...
The rat has taken some hits, but it doesnt seem bothered. If anything, it looks angry.
The beast is wheezing, and the floor is coated in its blood. Finish it while its low!!

Bandit
The figure lunges forward, hoping their twisted blades strike true.
Daggers down, the bandit beckons you forward, as if daring you to try.

Holes are present in the bandit's clothes and confidence. Press this advantage!
The clothes of the enemy are soaked red. Their breathing is haggard and weak.

Snake
The snake tests your dexterity, trying to sink its fangs deep into your calves.
Slithering away, it seems less interested in poisoning you that it was previously.
Its fangs are sharp and dripping with a sickly green substance... ready to strike!
It moves sporadically, not willing nor wanting you to strike it down once again.

This \"man\" moves fast for someone built like a boulder. He seems ready for your move.
Covered in scars, the barbarian's body is meaty and powerful. He is ready for more...
They're bleeding, and the breathing is haggard... but they almost seem to... ENJOY it.
You see the barbarian start to stumble. He can't keep up his rage for much longer...

Spider
The spiders looks coordinated, trying to deliver their immobilizing venom in unison.
The spiders skitter back to their webs. Perhaps they've miscalculated this foe?
Many spiders are before you, the various clicking and hissing deafening to your ears.
Only half the spiders remain. You are stronger, sure... but they are more numerous.
A few stragglers are all thats left. Crush them all. One. By. One!

Goblin
Wielding a pitiful shiv of some sort, the goblin makes an attempt at causing you harm.
The goblin's eyes grow wild, and its movements become even crazier than before.

Green slime
When the slime touches you, you feel a burning sensation... this slime is eating you!
The rubbery substance moves away, rolling across the floor... is it trying to escape?
The slime glistens like a greasy ball of sorts. When disturbed, the mass jiggles.
The slime is... smaller? Each hit seems to smash some of the mass off the main blob.
The slime is definitely smaller now; it could probably fit into both of your hands.

Rogue
The rogue tries to distract you, change your footing, shift your guard... then strike!
This swashbuckler is light on their feet, dancing around you... what're they planning?
They laugh and jeer at you, daring you to approach... the cutlass says you shouldn't.
They've dodged most of your attacks, but that sneer is starting to falter!!
You got some good hits in, and the rogue is moving slower and slower. Strike true!

Cultist
You hear multiple whispers as the figure brandishes a knife... twisted and eldritch.
The figure it difficult to see... as if they were double. They're hard to follow.
The cloak is intact, and you can see nothing of the figure within, save two red eyes.
The cloak is torn now, and what dim light shines is present reveals an inhuman visage.

Striking a tiny rodent is not very easy. It's attempting to sidestep your every move.
This echidna could actually be pretty cute if it weren't for the knife in its mouth.
You've hit it once or twice, but those adorable eyes are still set on their mission. 
You don't want to kill it... but the echidna is still determined. You may have to.

Ghoul
It strikes fast and hard with it's teeth, it's claws, it's tongue. Hungry for flesh.
An inhuman yelp escapes its mouth as it attempts to escape your blows.
The ghoul is emaciated and gaunt, but also strong. It howls a monstrous laugh. 
The wounds go deep, but they seem to be sealing... can this creature regenerate??

Its fist is the size of a small boulder, and will hurt like one if it makes contact!

They're bleeding in some spots, and they look upset at your success.
Haggard and bloody, the giant moans out, as if begging for your mercy.

They drink a extract of some sort, that makes them incredibly quick!

The clothes and charms have been torn away, revealing the spindly human underneath.
They're running low on extracts and charms. They're nearing their end!

Snarling and growling at you, it attempts to sink its teeth into your neck.
The wolf paces around you, trying to stand between you and its children.

The wolf is definitely hurting, but it shows no sign of weakness. It will win, or die!
This is it... the wolf is fiercely determined to keep its pups safe. It must succeed!!

Wyrmling
This dragon isn't big enough to breathe fire yet... but it can swipe at you!
The wyrm doesn't like it's odds, and attempts to avoid your blows.
It seems sure of itself... but it also hasn't been hit yet.
The wyrm is definitely more cautious now that it knows the sting of your blade.
If you knew any better, you'd think the small dragon was whimpering...

Ogre
As he roars, he swings his club at you. A club covered in blood, and also... snot?

This slime contorts and warps in fantastical ways, avoiding the edge of your sword.
The slime is gargantuan, and menacing. You can see your reflection in the black abyss.
As you slash, you cleave off more and more of the black monster. Clean it all away!
It doesn't look hurt, per se, but it is getting smaller. Keep at it!

Cult Leader
Out of their robed arms extends... tentacles!?! A horrid mix of man and monster?!
They use their eldritch abilities to their advantage, dashing away with wicked speed.
The cultist stands 8 feet tall, with 2 feet of... tentacles extending from the bottom.
The robed have been tattered, revealing a piscine appearance. The slitted eyes narrow.
The tentacles monster surely was human once before... but no humanity lies there now.
